# wordpress-codes
Some nifty wordpress-codes like filters, functions, shortcodes etc.

Just a bunch of things that I use from time to time or things that took a while to figure out and might be usefull for others. :)

Everything is placed under /files and should be named to understand what i does and have a description too.

## [Export Orders to XML](https://github.com/MattiasKallio/wordpress-codes/blob/main/files/woocommerce_orders_dump.md)
To export orders from Woocommerce to import with some plugin, I use Order Export Import XML

##  [Use an Elementor template as a footer](https://github.com/MattiasKallio/wordpress-codes/blob/main/files/add_elementor_template_as_footer.md)
Add a template, or a section under the Elementor library. In this example, the template is called "snillrik-footer".  This is the nicename of the template.

## [Add metadata fields to WordPress search](https://github.com/MattiasKallio/wordpress-codes/blob/main/files/add_metadata_to_search.md)
This is for adding metadata to the wordpress search.  This is useful for custom post types and custom fields.

## [Hide thumbnail image on single post](https://github.com/MattiasKallio/wordpress-codes/blob/main/files/hide_thumbnail_image.md)
If you want to add a checkbox to hide the thumbnail image on a single post, but still show it on list pages, archive pages etc.  This is how you do it.

## [Replace part of text in postmeta](https://github.com/MattiasKallio/wordpress-codes/blob/main/files/SQL_replace_part.md)
I just need to remember this SQL query to replace part of a text in a postmeta field. The "where" key is important, otherwise you will replace all the text in all the postmeta fields.
