# wordpress-codes
Some nifty wordpress-codes like filters, functions, shortcodes etc.

Just a bunch of things that I use from time to time or things that took a while to figure out and might be usefull for others. :)

Everything is placed under /files and should be named to understand what i does and have a description too.
